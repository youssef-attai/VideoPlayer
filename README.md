# Custom browser video player

### Video source is not properly set, so all functionalities currently do not work
Open `index.html`, and find the line `<video src="Harvard CS50 Week 2.mp4"></video>`.
As you can see, unless you have a video with the exact name of `Harvard CS50 Week 2.mp4`, the video player won't work.

The video source can be set dynamically by the user via an `Open video file` button or something like that, I am just too lazy to do it.
